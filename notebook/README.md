## Project Overview
This repository contains weekly programming exercises and project work completed for the *Fundamentals of Computer Programming with Python* module.  
The work demonstrates progressive learning of Python programming concepts through practical implementation.


## Objective (Included in Program)
The objective of this project is to:
- Understand core programming principles
- Develop problem-solving skills using Python
- Write clean, modular, and reusable code
- Apply theoretical concepts through practical exercises and projects

Each program includes comments describing its specific objective.



## How to Run Program
Ensure Python 3 is installed.
Open a terminal in the project directory.
Run a Python file using:

```bash
python filename.py
